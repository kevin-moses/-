I want to be able to build projects and bring forth ideas that can make people's lives easier and more fulfilling. I've been very blessed to receive a highly technical degree from a prestigious university, and I want to be able to spread the love of learning and knowledge distribution onto others as well. In terms of specific goals, I would be thrilled if any work I make or research I undergo can eventually help us in getting to Mars and Titan, fully relying on renewable energies, and having ownership and agency of the limited time we have. With that spirit in mind, here is a link to one of the projects I've created that helps spread and inform knowledge in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology: http://thejoin.cloud/
