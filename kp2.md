Lately I've been obsessed with the app HUJI. It's this concurrent mobile photography camera/editing tool that allows users to take photos composed in film 90's style, as opposed to sharp digital images made more popular as technology progressed. It's displayed in the style of a Kodak disposable camera, and you "look" thru the lens and snap a photo, which thereafter applies a lens flare, grainy filter, and a white timestamp on the corner to give it that classic retro 90's look. It's an app that has surprising staying power among my age group of Millenials-GenZer's, and I think that's because the app is reflective of the good years of our childhood when we got used to oversaturated and grainy film photos and gradually made our way to the more clear-cut (but less nostalgic) digital photo era. The app has small, almost imperceptible ads for now, which I love since it prioritizes the joyful experience of using the app over larger ad revenue that would increase additional cognitive overload users would get - after all, you never see an ad on the lens of a film camera! HUJI is free for now, but I would be interested in how the product would work with a one-time payment option, or even a small yearly subscription, which both seem preferable to ad revenue. Ideally I would like to see in-app ad revenue entirely removed to prioritize user experience.
