## 1 Feburary 2019 - Page Published

This website was published with github.io and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/kevin-moses/kmoses.github.io/edit/master/README.md).

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

**From the Github.io initialization:**

_Markdown Conventions_

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

_Jekyll Themes_

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kevin-moses/kmoses.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
